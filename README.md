## Description

With `Presentador`, you simply put the elements you want on each slide and it will place them in the right place. No more messing with font-sizes and positions, just focus on your presentation.

There is only a single layout depending on the elements of your slide. `Presentador` parses the elements in each slide and assigns a certain pre-defined layout to it.

## Contributing

We could use all the help we can get. So please feel free to go through our open [issues]('https://github.com/kbariotis/presentador/issues') or create one if thought of a new cool feature or found a bug.

## Compilation

The process of compiling a presentation is actually quite simple.
